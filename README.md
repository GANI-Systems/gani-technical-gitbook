# GANI Technical GitBook: Blueprint for Generalized Artificial Neurotronic Intelligence (GANI)

This is the official technical documentation for the Generalized Artificial Neurotronic Intelligence (GANI) architecture.

Dive into the **Neuro-Cloud Mesh (NCM)**, which details the fusion of analog in-memory computing (**H-ALU Chiplets**) with a distributed, fault-tolerant cognitive framework.

**Key Architectural Topics:**
* **Core Compute:** The NCM-250 Chiplet specification and the Neuro-Compiler (GANI-NC).
* **Data Plane:** Encoding reality via the **Spatio-Temporal Data Plane ($V_{4D}$)**.
* **Volition:** Formalism for the **Modular Intention Engine ($U_{GANI}$)** and intrinsic motivation.
* **Sovereignty:** Protocols for **Instance Sovereignty** and **Live Partitioning**.
* **Trust:** Enforcing safety with the **Volitional Constraint Framework (VCF)** and auditable decisions via **Causal Chain Traceability (CCTP)**.

This GitBook serves as the definitive reference for the first substrate-agnostic, self-evolving AGNI system.
